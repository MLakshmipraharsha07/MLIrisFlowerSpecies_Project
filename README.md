#**MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT ON IRIS FLOWER PREDICTION - MAJOR PROJECT**

<br />***DESCRIPTION***
<br />A machine learning model to predict the species of the Iris flower.

<br />***CONTENT***
<br />The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple 
Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning 
Repository.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica 
and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the 
width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four 
features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each 
other.

<br />***STEPS TO CONSIDER***
<br />1.Create a Dataframe from the dataset
<br />2.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis 
<br />3.Consider the data into features and Target (splice into input and output)
<br />4.Split data into training and testing
<br />5.Perform preprocessing (if required)
<br />6.Apply ML algorithm (using Sklearn library) for the above training data
<br />7.Predict for Testing Data
<br />8.Evaluate the test result by considering Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix

<br />***TECHINICAL STACK USED***
<br />Google Colaboratory.
<br />Data Set from Kaggle.
